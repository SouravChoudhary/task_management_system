## Problem Breakdown

In modern software systems, especially in project management, productivity tools, and operational dashboards, there's a recurring need to manage tasks effectively. These systems require a backend that is:

- **Scalable** to handle a growing number of users and tasks.
- **Modular** so that it can evolve without breaking other parts of the application.
- **Maintainable** with a clear separation of concerns.
- **Extensible** for future features like notifications, deadlines, and priorities.

This service solves that need by providing a clean and focused Task Management API as an independent microservice. It allows other services or frontend applications to create, retrieve, update, and delete tasks through a simple HTTP-based interface.
